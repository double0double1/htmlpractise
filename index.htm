<h1>My first website using Python and Django</h1>

<p>This work is done as an assignment for the <em>Web Application Technologies and Django </em> course as part of the
<a href ='https://www.coursera.org/specializations/django'><strong>Django For Everybody
Specialization</strong></a> provided by University of Michigan via <a href = 'https://www.coursera.org/'>Coursera website.</a>
This assignment is intended to improve the basic knowledge of a student in HTML,<span > by creating a simple web page</span>
and hosting it via<a href = 'https://www.pythonanywhere.com/'> pythonanywhere</a>.</p>

<p>This is the first time I'm getting my hands on creating a web page using html. The creation of an HTML page is a very satisfying process as it's
wonderful to observe how inserting a few tags in between the text creates a well defined structure for the document.</p>

<p>To finish and earn the grades for this assignment, I'm supposed to meet some criteria in the HTML document which Im writing. <div>The following requirements are required for the completion of the assignment: <button style = "display: none",  id = 'sh'; onclick ="show()"> Show</button> <span> </span><button id = 'hi'; onclick ="hide()"> Hide</button></div>
<ul id = 'list', style = "color: darkblue ;  display: block;" >
	<li>I should be using at least one example of each of the following tags: span, p, div, h1, and ul </li>
	<li>I must include three a tags and three li tags.</li>
	<li>I must have some bold and italics text in the document without using b or i tags.</li>
</ul>
<p>Although there is a lot of flexibility within those parameters, it can still be a little challenge for a first timer. First look at this html says that
I've met those parameters to pass the assignment, I still have to run the HTML content in the W3C validator and then post the link in the
course autograder to verify if I've included everything.
